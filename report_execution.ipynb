    "No visuals are included since this `.ipynb` file is intended for a technical audience. To pose questions, you must first create an instance of the Agent class, and provide it with the parameters:\n",
    "- openai_model - use any of the supported OpenAI models, but not all are efficient or may not support all AIMethods\n",
    "- workspace_id - GoodData workspace ID. A semantic model from this workspace is used and reports are executed in this context\n",
    "- temperature - when setting a value higher than 0 (default), answers may be less deterministic but also more inventive\n",
    "\n",
    "Then agent method `process` is called with the following parameters:\n",
    "- method\n",
    "  - RAW - Calls OpenAI API chatCompletions, without any specialties.\n",
    "  - FUNC - Calls OpenAI API chatCompletions, with a pre-defined .json structure, using function calling.\n",
    "  - LANGCHAIN - Uses Langchain to create an embedding from provided documents in the \"./data/\" folder, which is then used to enrich the prompt.\n",
    "- question - the natural question asking for the report execution\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a plot, simply ask a question in the format that you would use to name your visualization (assuming the target audience had an IQ of 80 - so GPT can understand it), such as `Clothing, Electronics and Home revenue per region`."

    "A second issue is that generation will always be slower, even with persistence. Since there's no way to force the agent to output only the .json format, the answers are longer, as they contain a lengthy explanation.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most shocking conclusion from this proof of concept (POC) is that the quality of the prompting is as crucial, if not more so, as the tooling that surrounds it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, 'agent.py' contains as much prompt text as it does code. This can be attributed to the relative maturity of the OpenAI tooling, despite the recent inception of this technological boom. It also underscores the fact that when providing prompts, specificity is often required.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the quality of the responses in this case was, at best, questionable. There is significant room for improvement, and if we were to launch this in its current form, it would likely be met with laughter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to note that the data this POC relies on is simplistic, and this simplicity is further magnified by the reduced number of options from which GPT can choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while LLMs are far from perfect, they can still be useful for tasks of moderate complexity. Personally, I believe it's more important to acknowledge and highlight these flaws rather than indulge in marketing BS, as many sadly do, which could only backfire in the long run."
